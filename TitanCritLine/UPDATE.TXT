Titan [CritLine] - a World of Warcraft Addon


DEVELOPERS:
-----------

CritLine Concept by Sordit
Titan Conversion until version 0.3.7 by Uggh
Continued Development from 0.3.7 by FALLI
Latest Changes 0.4.0f/g by Snowblind


IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTES: 
-----------------------

ADDON VERSION 0.3.9x to 0.4.0x

To filter out some special mobs, I must add deep database modifications and save the old values too.
If you use the option to filter out these special mobs, your whole CritLine records are under
investigation, this can result in errors, I hope I aware on all possible erros that can occur, but
I can't test it out by myself.

So, please, if you get problems with these conversion let me know.

With toggeling these option, the addon try to restore your old datas if they are available.


GAME VERSION 1.7.x to 1.8.x 

To make CritLine ready for WoW v1.8.x I use a few new functions from the new version. There are many
changes in the data structure and so an update process is needed. You found the old settings in this
folder 'x:\x\World of Warcraft\WTF\AccountName\SavedVariables.lua' or
'x:\x\World of Warcraft\WTF\AccountName\SavedVariables\TitanCritLine.lua'. The variable called
'TitanCritLineSettings'.

In the new version you find the settings in this folder: 
'x:\x\World of Warcraft\WTF\AccountName\CharacterName\SavedVariables\TitanCritLine.lua'. The variable
called 'TCL_SETTINGS'.

The update process converts the old table to the new one, your data isn't lost.



BUGS, SUGGESTIONS, NOTES
------------------------

for bugs and suggestions please go to: http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=2344

and I need help too, with each new game version, the horrible translators of the game change or
tweak a combat log message, so I need the GlobalStrings.lua from the english and french version.

Ty !
